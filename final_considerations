##model limitations

returns are independent, such as there are no streak, regime and correlations.

payoff fixed and irrealistic

probabilities are constant

the risk is always a fixed fraction of the actual capital.

##path dependency

the order of gains and loss matters in this case.

two sequences with the same amount of wins/losses can result in much different final capitals.

##why positive EV does not guarantee survive.

Positive expected value does not imply capital preservation.

##sensivity of the parameters

small variations in the risk per trade can lead to big variations in ruin probability

##why we use Monte-Carlo

theres no constant solution

the path matter

analytic fail in catch dradowns and ruins.
